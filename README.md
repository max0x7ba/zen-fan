# zen-fan
Minimalist Linux fan control designed to be simple and powerful.

## Design objectives
Linux hardware monitoring [`hwmon`][2] exposes temperature measurements and fan controls as files in `sysfs`. An ideal fan control application would:

1. Obtain temperature measurements by reading from the sensor files.
2. Control fan speeds by writing into fan speed control files.
3. Minimize its own CPU and RAM resource usage. One process with one thread is the ideal.
4. Be robust against hardware changes. Plugging in a USB device must not break the fan control application.
5. Be as simple as possible.

## Implementation notes
To achieve its design objectives `zen-fan`:

* Is written in plain `bash` using version 4 features. No compilation is required.
* Doesn't invoke any other executables and doesn't depend on any other software.
* Doesn't spawn any processes/threads on each iteration.

Empirical average CPU time of one iteration is under 27 milliseconds, resident size is under 4MB.

`zen-fan` was inspired by [`fancontrol`][1]. Unlike `fancontrol`,`zen-fan`:
* Doesn't fail to start when hardware changes, a USB device is plugged-in/out.
* Doesn't crash when fans have been adjusted by another application.
* Doesn't spawn new processes on each iteration.

# Usage

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in `zen-fan.d` directory. Use [host.supernova.cfg](zen-fan.d/host.supernova.cfg) as an example.

Copy and modify an existing configuration file to suit your machine and test it. E.g.:

```
cd zen-fan
cp zen-fan.d/host.supernova.cfg zen-fan.d/host.$HOSTNAME.cfg # Modify zen-fan.d/host.$HOSTNAME.cfg to suit your machine
sudo -E ./zen-fan.sh # Loads zen-fan.d/host.$HOSTNAME.cfg
```

## Run from the source directory
Once your configuration is ready, you can run `zen-fan` from the source directory as is:
```
cd zen-fan
sudo -E ./zen-fan.sh
```

## Install systemd service
Once your configuration is ready, you may like to install `zen-fan` as systemd service:

```
cd zen-fan
sudo ./install.zen-fan.service.sh
```

## Examine service status

```
systemctl --no-pager status zen-fan
```

```
